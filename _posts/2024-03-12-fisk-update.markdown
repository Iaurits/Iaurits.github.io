As a part of this project we decided that it would be interesting not just to simply analyze the crime rate or the area, but also the resolution of the crime. Some crimes tends to have softer punishment, such as fines or warnings, while others tend to have harsher punishments where the offender is actually prosecuted. In this case we thought it might be a good idea to see whether there is a difference between the number of booked arrests (offender is arrested and taking to a police station) and cited arrests (offender is let of with a fine or warning), depending on the neighborhood. Below can be seen a plot of prostitution in San Fransisco where each area has been colored depending on the ratio between booked arrests and all arrests.

Here we can see that areas such as Tenderloin, Central, Northern, Mission and Richmond tend to have fewer booked arrests for prostitution compared to the total number of arrest resolutions for prostitution. Areas such as Taraval, Park and Southern tend to have a higher booked rate. However, it is important to know that this rate is calculated in relation to all other resolutions, so this plot does not indicate that there is more prostitution in the aformentioned areas, simply that more often offenders gets taken to the police station. In fact areas where the rate is low could be due to the fact the patrolling police are more busy or more needed on the road and therefore more often decide to let offenders off with fines as for example Tendorloin is a neighborhood notorious for criminal activity.

We notice from the actual prostitution related crime that most of the cited cases are loitering, most probably prostitutes who are then fined by the police instead of being taking into custody. We also notice that most more serious crimes such as pimping and human trafficking are almost always booked. All of this supports our hypothesis that police in this area tend to focus more on the serious crimes and are more leniant towards less serious crimes. All of this might be due to the fact that Tenderloin has a high crime rate in general and police are understaffed in the area. An article from the San Francisco Standard made in 2023 explains how police in the area has resorted to pulling back cops from retirement and discharged officers to do drug busts (https://sfstandard.com/2023/02/28/tenderloin-crackdown-brings-back-troubled-cops-dubious-covert-tactics/). Another article from CBS News made in 2023 explains how the current major is requesting more funding to police departments, especially in Tenderloin to try and combat drug issues in the area (https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/san-francisco-crime-tenderloin-drugs/). All of this might explain why police in Tenderloin generally tend to choose more lenient resolutions for crimes like loitering.
